readthedocs-sphinx-search - Search as you type for Read the Docs
================================================================

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs-sphinx-search, and is currently modded for use in `python-telegram-bot <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot>`_.

Modded features
---------------

- Made the theme to work with Furo. It is always dark mode by default.
- The search bar is now in the middle.
- Multiple elements are now rounded.
- Included the ability to perform an advanced search - Search by attributes, class, methods, parameters, and general documentation. Note that it will work for pure python documentation and is very much modified for PTB, so if you want this feature you'll have to make a couple of changes.
